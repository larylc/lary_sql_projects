<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Using 2014-2015 data gathered from the <a
href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/si/ds/pubschls.asp">California
Department of Education</a>, we will be using <code>R</code>,
<code>Python</code>, and <code>SQL</code> to
<code>gain insight into what kind of factors are associated with high school closures</code>
in the state of California.</p>
<p>The purpose of this brief analysis is to address the query above,
generate ideas for more in depth analyses, and practice using R, Python,
and SQL simultaneously.</p>

<p>From this table we can see clear differences in <strong>SAT score
related variables</strong>, <strong>enrollment related
variables</strong>, and <strong>funding related variables</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div id="are-these-significant-differences" class="section level2">
<h2>Are These Significant Differences?</h2>
<p>Our next step in this exploratory analysis would be to choose some of
the variables and test how significant the differences we observe are.
The reason we are testing a 1 variable from the 3 types of variables is
because these variables are probably correlated, so it doesn’t make
sense to check all of them when they would produce relatively similar
results. Finding the most significant variables is beyond the scope of
this brief analysis. To keep thing simple our alpha value will be
0.05.</p>
<p>To check to see if there is a relationship between high school status
and funding type, we are going to use a chi-square test of
independence.</p>

<p>Taking a look at the pval column from this table, there appears to be
a significant association between status and funding.</p>
<p>Next, we are interested in performing a t-test to examine whether
there is a statistically significant association between status and SAT
score total.</p>

<h1>Recap and Way Forward</h1>
<p>Funding, SAT scores, and enrollment are all associated with high
school status. The typical closed school is more likely to directly
funded than active school, have an average SAT Score that is <strong>53
points</strong> less than the overall California average, and have less
students than other schools. Closed schools stayed open on average for
about <strong>13 years</strong>.</p>
The time sensitivity for this project did prevent deeper dives into the
data. For example, education type (like SOCType and Educational Option
Type) could have been another factor that affects school status. The
education types were not explored because they had numerous categories
and it would have taken much more time to sort through. Additionally,
school locations could be associated with school closures. Here is a map
of all of the school

<p>Regions with more schools tend to have more closures. However, there
maybe a relationship between status and particular regions.
Additionally, there is the possibility that regions as variable is too
broad to show more granular county, city, or district patterns. It would
be interesting to combine this data with wealth data gathered from
external sources.</p>
<p>Finally, using the findings from above, an interesting future project
could attempt to better identify which specific variables among the 3
categories. These variables could then used to create a multiple
logistic regression model that could help predict school closures for
future years.</p>
